## Introduction
* Lower Hybrid wavs (LHW) have the attractive property that they damp efficiently via Landau resonance at relatively low electron temparture on "tail electrons" at parallel phase speeds of approximately $(2.5 - 3) x v_{te}$, where $v_{te}=(2T_e/m_e)^2$ is the electron themal speed.
* As a consequence they can be used to drive current in the outer half of tokamak plasmas in order to broaden the current profile and access and optimize improved energy confinement regimes.
* Several advanced reactor designs as well as the ITER device incorporate off-axis lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in order to control the shear reversal point and maintain high bootstrap current fraction.

### Plasma vertical stabilization in ITER
[Plasma vertical stabilization in ITER](http://stacks.iop.org/0029-5515/55/i=7/a=073021)

by Y. Gribov, et al.

* Two indices characterising plasma VS were studied.
	* The maximum value of plasma vertical displacement due to free drift that can be stopped by the VS system;
	* the maximum root mean square value of low frequency noise in the $dZ/dt$ measurement signal used in the VS feedback loop.

* The first VS index was calculated using the PET code for 15 MA plasmas with the nominal position and shape.
* The second VS index was studied with the DINA code in the most demanding simulations for plasma magnetic control of 15 MA scenarios with the fastest plasma current ramp-up and early X-point formation, the fastest plasma current ramp-down in a divertor configuration, and an H to L mode transition at the current flattop.

1. The studies performed demonstrate that the VS in-vessel coils, adopted recently in the baseline design, significantly increase the range of plasma controllability in comparison with the stabilising systems VS1 and VS2, providing operating margins sufficient to achieve ITER's goals specified in the project requirements.

# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  佛曰：命由己造，相由心生，世间万物皆是化相，心不动，万物皆不动，心不变，万物皆不变。
  佛曰：坐亦禅，行亦禅，一花一世界，一叶一如来，春来花自青，秋至叶飘零，无穷般若心自在，语默动静体自然。
